-- Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping

-- 1. Count the total number of books in the library
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_books FROM Books;

-- 2. Count the number of distinct authors
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_id) AS total_authors FROM Authors;

-- 3. Find the total number of book copies available in the library
SELECT SUM(copies_available) AS total_copies_available FROM Books;

-- 4. Get the average number of copies per book
SELECT AVG(copies_available) AS avg_copies_per_book FROM Books;

-- 5. Count the number of books issued to each member
SELECT m.name AS member_name, COUNT(ib.issue_id) AS books_issued
FROM Members m
JOIN IssuedBooks ib ON m.member_id = ib.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id;

-- 6. List authors and the number of books they have written
SELECT a.name AS author_name, COUNT(b.book_id) AS books_written
FROM Authors a
LEFT JOIN Books b ON a.author_id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id;

-- 7. Find genres with the average number of copies available
SELECT genre, AVG(copies_available) AS avg_copies
FROM Books
GROUP BY genre;

-- 8. List members who have borrowed more than 2 books
SELECT m.name AS member_name, COUNT(ib.issue_id) AS books_borrowed
FROM Members m
JOIN IssuedBooks ib ON m.member_id = ib.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id
HAVING COUNT(ib.issue_id) > 2;

-- 9. Count how many books were issued each year
SELECT YEAR(issue_date) AS issue_year, COUNT(*) AS total_issues
FROM IssuedBooks
GROUP BY YEAR(issue_date);

-- 10. Show the total number of books issued and returned
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_issued,
  COUNT(return_date) AS total_returned
FROM IssuedBooks;

-- 11. Show average number of books written by authors (for those who have at least 1 book)
SELECT AVG(book_count) AS avg_books_per_author
FROM (
  SELECT author_id, COUNT(*) AS book_count
  FROM Books
  GROUP BY author_id
) AS subquery;

-- 12. List authors who have written more than 3 books
SELECT a.name AS author_name, COUNT(b.book_id) AS total_books
FROM Authors a
JOIN Books b ON a.author_id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id
HAVING COUNT(b.book_id) > 3;
