📊 Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping
===========================================

🎯 **Objective:**Use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize and analyze data in the Library Management System database.

🛠️ **Tools Used:**

*   DB Browser for SQLite
    
*   MySQL Workbench
    

📂 **Deliverables:**

*   SQL script containing queries using SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, and HAVING
    

📘 **Hints / Mini Guide:**

1.  Apply aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG on numeric fields
    
2.  Use GROUP BY to organize data into categories
    
3.  Use HAVING to filter grouped results (similar to WHERE but for aggregates)
    

🧪 **Examples Included in SQL Script:**

*   Count total number of books
    
*   Sum of available copies in the library
    
*   Average number of copies per book
    
*   Count of books issued to each member
    
*   Authors and the number of books they've written
    
*   Grouping by genre and finding average copies
    
*   Members who borrowed more than 2 books
    
*   Number of books issued each year
    
*   Count of issued and returned books
    
*   Authors with more than 3 books
    
*   Average books per author (with at least one)
    

📁 **File Structure:**

*   task4\_aggregate\_grouping.sql – Contains all SQL queries for this task
    
*   README.txt – This description file
    

🚀 **How to Use:**

1.  Open the SQL script in DB Browser for SQLite or MySQL Workbench
    
2.  Execute the queries step-by-step
    
3.  Observe grouped and aggregated results
    
4.  Tweak and experiment with values for deeper understanding
